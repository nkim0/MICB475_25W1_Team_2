**November 17, 2025 Meeting Minutes**

- Rename groups
  - cancer: yes vs no
  - Alcohol: no consumption vs consumption

Diversity
- beta diversity - try Bray Curtis to get better spread
  - worth trying unweighted as well

Core Microbiome
- try at level higher than ASVs
- Core microbiome analysis seems meaningless
  - something is off because everything is 100% off from each other
- Something seems off, may have to be 0% stringent for core microbiome
 
Indicator Species Analysis
- see how many are unique to each group
- no shared core 

Deseq
- everything is downregulated compared to the control (no cancer, no risk alcohol)

For next week:
1) Try taxonomic bar plots
2) reproduce the graphs in our data paper
3) no significant taxonomic difference as of right now, so try functional analysis
4) Start on the functional analysis and start on the slides and make a story
5) Simple is better for slides!!

* Think about functional analysis because we see no significance
* Try to see if there's anything wrong with the dataset, run the functional analysis, pause on the classifier?
* troubleshoot the beginning
* if something comes out as significant, we can try machine learning
