# Meeting Minutes
## Oct 9, 2025
- ACS and NCI have the same data, but from different cohorts and sequenced differently
- examines the oral microbiome and both smoking/alcohol
- ACS and NCI have ~600 samples each:
  - should use NCI because it has more samples
  - use only one data to prevent batch effect from combining

Research Question:
- categorize alcohol consumption data: none, low, high (no more than 3 categories)
  - may want to look into papers to see how much is a lot
- categorize smoking: never, former, current
- control: no alcohol + no smoking
- cross compare everything (9 comparisons)
  - isolate which combinations have the bigger effect on microbiome
- should take out higher BMI samples since it may be a confounding variable
- Compare gender (male/female) if we have time? <- no cut this out!!
- What does Case vs. Control mean??
  - case: head and neck cancer
  - control: no cancer
- Stratify the sample by cancer vs. no cancer and test the effect of alcohol/smoking on cancer patients
  - same code, but get different bins
- Functional analysis with both smoking and alcohol â€“ can omit, focus on taxonomic analysis
  - if we don't get anything interesting, we can do functional analysis
 
**For next meeting:**
- Start to process the data on qiime!!!
- Prepare a concrete research question for next meeting and the codes to run
- Build out outline for the next 2 weeks
