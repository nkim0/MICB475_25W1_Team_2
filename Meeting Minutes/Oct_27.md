**Oct 20, 2025 Meeting Minutes**
- We're looking at moderate alcohol consumpton + current smokers in head and neck cancer
- Drive unique microbial/taxonomic sigantures that can predict head and neck cancer

(1) alpha and beta diversity
(2) core microbiome and ISA (maybe replace ISA to **deseq2**) - we can decide as we run
(3) random forest classifier

+ potentially add differential abundance as aim 3
+ differential abundance in healthy and not healthy (DESEQ2)
+ core microbiome does not tell you difference in abundance
+ may be nice to have but

Combining datasets:
- 8-10 samples per condition is enough
- just have to explain your choices!!
- can use one dataset as training, one dataset as testing/predictor
- explain choices - it was similar dataset
- part of your analysis can explain that it doesn't work

Difference between ISA and Core microbiome??
- one is shared and unique
- one only looks at unique one

- Maybe look at something that is lost from the community, not a unique species
  - core microbiome analysis

FOCUS on RESEARCH QUESTION!!!
- how the individual/subsequent aims help you answer the question
