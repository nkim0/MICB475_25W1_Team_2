**November 28 Meeting Minutes**

- put names on the slide
  - research by: team#
    
Introduction
- too many words
- we can give notes to the team presenting
- but not blatantly notes so they read off
  
About the dataset
- cite with author et al.
- too many words
- split into 2

Transition slide
- highlight the aims!!!
- overview and narrative
- Highlight the research objective
- keep it simple

Bottom of the slide - a timeline of the aim
- remind people where you're at

**Title of the slide need to be the key takeaway of the figure or slide!!!!**
- maybe better to remove the CPS II cohort
- we're not doing prediction, just adding confusion

Figure 1
- change the colors!!
- looks like a qualitative scale
- find ones that are distinct colours
- not significantly different taxonomic composition across groups
- data changed for some reason

Figure 2
- non-significant
- put in p-value or ns for figure

Figure 3
- data changed

Figure 4
- based off genus level
- most of it are shared

*Try to tell a story, relate it back to the big picture!!
- example: based on the data, we didn't find any taxonomic composition, microbial diversity is similar independent of alcohol use, etc...

Figure 5
- don't include it if we don't want to

Figure 6
- everything was downregulated compared to no cancer/no alcohol
- 3 of the graphs per cohort - pairwise comparisons
- can make the graph red?
- can also tabulate the data to make it easier
- this many downregulated, this many upregulated, etc. per group 
- do NOT say downregulation, we're looking at abundance

Future directions and limitations
- specific - list them all!!
