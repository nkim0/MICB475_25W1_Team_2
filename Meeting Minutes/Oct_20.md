**Research Question**
How does alcohol consumption affect taxonomic and functional diversity in the oral microbial biome across smoking status?

**Aims:**

**1. Alpha diversity (no cancer)**
- Within each smoking status group, comparing alpha diversity of the alcohol consumption group (3x3)
- Within each alcohol consumption group, comparing alpha diversity of the smoking status group (3x3)

**2. Beta diversity  (no cancer)**
- Beta diversity analysis comparing smoking and alcohol consumption on individuals
  - 9 group comparison
- Taxa Abundance  (no cancer)

**3. Core microbiome analysis between the 9 possible pairings**
- 9 groups

**4. Cancer Context	 (with and without cancer)**
- Alpha diversity between the same smoking status and alcohol consumption between groups with cancer and without cancer
- Beta Diversity between All?????
- All 18 groups
- Core microbiome analysis between cancer and no cancer

**Comments on the research question:**
- Maybe make question a little more specific (ie. how to specify that alcohol consumption refers to grams of ethanol)
- Could make question more specific to say smokers in order to add in the cancer factor
  - Ie. using only one of the smoker conditions

**Comments on the aims:**
- Alpha and beta diversity should only be one aim together (less spread out)

- Core microbiome as second aim is good
  - 9x9
  - Could add indicative species analysis into one aim
  - Microbial signatures across all the different groups

- Include a functional analysis for the sake of the proposal
  - Differential abundance is the alternative
  - Make functional analysis the third aim
  - Need to pick between functional analysis and differential abundance

- Could also include microbial signatures into the research question
- Should remove aim four (about cancer) and replace it with a different analysis that answers the question better
- Need to classify differently between female and male because what the variables are considered high low and none is different between sexes
  - Do not control for BMI because that is too many factors

*Don’t have to stick to these aims for the final project if we don’t want to!

**Functional analysis discussion:**
Use Picrest (?)
CAN’T use words like expression because we are looking at DNA, not RNA
Looking at the POTENTIAL of the community but we are not actually proving that those functions are actually occurring
We’re only using 16S rRNA
Issue with 16s is resolution and how specific the microbe is (ie. species, genus, strain, family)
Does not resolve past the genus
Don’t know the strains meaning we can’t determine the function
Ie. E. coli strains can do very different things

*Say that there is the potential for these functions or the FUNCTIONAL POTENTIAL of the community!
Also use the word REPRESENTATION

**Tips for writing the proposal:**
- Need to frame it as answering the research question and flow from aim one to three/four
- Should have around 15-20 references (have good amount of scientific evidence)
  - Should be diverse background of references

- Table for aim outlines:
  - If we state statistical analysis then be SPECIFIC (what type of analysis)
  - Must be SPECIFIC for everything
  - Ie. what type of alpha or beta diversity we are going to be doing

**Do not be general!!!
