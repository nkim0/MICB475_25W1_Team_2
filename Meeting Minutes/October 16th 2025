Need to be more specific based on the metadata and what info we can take for alcohol
* Ie. grams of ethanol, volumes of alcohol consumed
* What exactly about alcohol are we going to be looking at 
In what terms of the microbiome are we looking at (also need to be more specific to develop research question)
* Ie. functional diversity, taxonomic diversity, predicting
Most likely taxonomic diversity
Can look at other proposals to see what the aims are

How to add smoking factor:
Have 9 total variables or combinations to look at for taxonomic diversity
* Ie. could be a heat map

How to phrase research question:
“Something as a function of something”
* Ie. how taxonomic diversity drives/affects/drives something 
* Ie. how does alcohol affect the microbiome
Either smoking status on alcohol or alcohol on smoking status
Don’t phrase as a “cause…effect” because we cannot do a study in that way
Phrase as “how does…” or “does…” - make it an open ended question
“How does _ change the microbiome based on _?”

For the aims: we need at least 3 (could do 4)
How does aim one give results that lead into aim 2
* Ie. looking at alpha beta diversity and changes in microbiomes -> how does ISA change based on alpha diversity, etc.

In the introduction:
Focus on the microbiome
Should be discussed within the FIRST paragraph
Easy to get lost on discussing the GENERAL effects of alcohol
Can have a few sentences on later on
Should be 1-1.5 pages MAX

Trouble shooting the code for QIIME2
Currently taking a long time to run
Try doing screen and then after session gets timed out and kicked go back into the server and look at the screen to see if it still running
Remember to title files without “spaces”

For next time:
Brainstorm a few aims for the proposal as well as how we will analyze aims
