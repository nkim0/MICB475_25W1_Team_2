**Nov 3 Meeting Minutes**

Found out that cancer referred to both HNC and pancreatic cancer

Alpha Diversity plot:
- consider bar plot with median and standard deviation (error bars) instead of scatter plot
- put blue and red side by side
- can also use gm_jitter in scatterplot

- one sample isn't enough for one of the groups - best to leave it behind

Next Meeting:
- November 14, 2025 12:15pm outside of our usual meeting room

Important things to note:
- Don't use default themes for R (ggplot)
  - good for initial plotting, but choose a different theme later
  - bigger title, different labels, etc.
  - Hans recommends theme 'classic' but choose one and stick to it
- choose a color scheme and STICK TO IT!!
- something appropriate for colorblind people
- document the code along as well with comments
- do small things now, save time later
