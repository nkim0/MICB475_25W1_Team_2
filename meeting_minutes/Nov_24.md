**Meeting Minutes**

- tell Avril where file is located on the server and the file itself and he will run it (functional analysis)
- problem with the server

- beta diversity didn't work
- core microbiome similar at the genus level - 85% are similar
  - matches our data because there was no significance between the groups
- threshold is arbitrary - just choose one and keep it the same
  
- the paper didn't use greengenes or silva, used another database for oral microbiome
- if truncation is too short, any short reads will be dropped
- trying to retain 85% of reads

- maybe rerun everything at the genus level
- diversity, ISA, deseq, etc.
- more interpretable, easier at genus level
- no significant difference

- smoking and pancreatic/HNC doesn't seem to impact oral microbiome
- write out the final story!!

- swap meeting to Friday so we can get the slides checked
- 2pm-2:45pm on Friday!!
